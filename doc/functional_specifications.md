Functional Specifications Document
==================================

This working document outlines the functional specifications for the development of a daily question-based application inspired by Duolingo. It aims to describe and organize the features derived from user needs analysis.

Introduction
------------

### Context

The project focuses on creating a multi-platform application that delivers daily questions to users using spaced repetition techniques. The app is accessible via mobile, web, and CLI interfaces, targeting various user categories such as students, professionals, and casual learners.

### Glossary

-   **Spaced Repetition**: A learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals to enhance long-term retention.

-   **CLI**: Command-Line Interface for terminal-based interactions with the application.

-   **API**: Application Programming Interface, allowing backend functionalities to be accessed programmatically.

-   **Category**: A grouping mechanism for questions (e.g., Science, History).

### Objectives

The application aims to achieve the following:

-   **Automation**: Provide daily questions to users based on a pre-defined learning schedule.

-   **Engagement**: Increase user retention through gamified features like progress tracking and notifications.

-   **Scalability**: Support growth in user base and question categories without major architectural changes.

-   **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is available on multiple platforms (mobile, web, CLI).

### State of the Art

#### Existing Solutions

-   **Duolingo**: Offers gamified language learning but focuses only on language-based questions.

-   **Quizlet**: Provides flashcard-based learning but lacks advanced spaced repetition algorithms.

-   **Anki**: Utilizes a spaced repetition algorithm but has limited gamification and UI appeal.
